#2 Chromotin dynamics 
Although some aspects of the 3D genome architecture are conserved in different cell types, notable reorganization can happen in distinct biological processes and cell types.

(illustarted by examples)

#### 3D Genome Reorganization During the Cell Cycle
#### 3D Genome Organization of the Inactive X Chromosome
#### 3D Genome Reorganization During Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation
#### 3D Genome Organization in Pluripotent Stem Cells
