#2 Chromotin dynamics 
1. [Cell Cycle](#1)
2. [Inactive X Chromosome](#2)
3. [Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation](#3)

Although some aspects of the 3D genome architecture are conserved in different cell types, notable reorganization can happen in distinct biological processes and cell types. Dramatic changes may include mitosis process or X chromosome inactivation. Subtles changes may also important and may contribute to cell differentiation and reprogramming. Here we will introduce some cases that exemplify how dynamic changes influence the functions and formatons.


## 3D Genome Reorganization During the Cell Cycle<a name="1"></a>
Mitotic chromosomes are among the most recognizable structures in the cell, yet for over a century their internal organization remains largely unsolved. [Naumova N et](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24200812) applied 3C, 5C and Hi-C techniques together and proposed mechanism about chromotin get condensed upon entering mitosis and how to reserve back in child cells. Here are few discoveries:
- In interphase: highly compartmentalized; cell type-specific organization. In metaphase: homogenous folding state that is locus-independent, common to all chromosomes, and consistent among cell types, suggesting a general principle of metaphase chromosome organization.
- At M phase, previously described features of interphase chromosome organization, such as TADs and compartments, ap- pear to be completely erased.
- Mitotic chromosomes are folded in two steps： 
    - First, linear compaction is achieved by the formation of stochastic arrays of consecutive loops (80–120 kb in size), probably through loop extrusion mediated by SMC complexes [[1]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/14864).
    - Second, axial compression occurs to form the cylindrical shape of a mitotic chromosome.

After mitosis, all the structures should be rapidly estabilished to guarantee a proper funtion as the parent cells. This process may largely depend on specific bookmarks on the chromosomes. (A great figure summary of this process is [here](https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-8935-7-25#Fig1)). More insights of cell-fate comformation alterations of chromosome could be even closely surveyed by single-cell Hi-C study [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28682332).


## 3D Genome Organization of the Inactive X Chromosome <a name="2"></a>
Homologous chromosomes other than the X chromosome have highly similar high-order chro- matin structure: The active X chromosome (Xa) has TADs of regular size, whereas the inactive X chromosome (Xi) is partitioned into two large, contiguous domains, with a general absence of TADs. Similar Xi organization is conserved across the human, rhesus macaque, and mouse. The boundary oftwo large domains on Xi lies near the DXZ4 macrosatellite and its orthologs, which are bound by CTCF on Xi but not on Xa [[3]](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/31/E4504/tab-figures-data), [[4]](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2012-13-8-r70), [[5]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25497547).

## 3D Genome Reorganization During Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation<a name="3"></a>
In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), TADs serve as stable organizational units, TAD boundary positioning is largely unchanged when hESCs differentiate into four distinct early embryonic cell lineages. However, the inter- or intra- TAD interactions level are changed in concert with the transcription levels and epigenetic states [[6]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14222).

Another study found tissue type–specific feature ofgenome organization termed FIREs (frequently interacting regions), which involve multiple partners in the neighborhood and represent local chromatin interaction hot spots [[7]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27851967).
