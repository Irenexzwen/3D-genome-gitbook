#2 Chromotin dynamics 
Although some aspects of the 3D genome architecture are conserved in different cell types, notable reorganization can happen in distinct biological processes and cell types. Dramatic changes may include mitosis process or X chromosome inactivation. Subtles changes may also important and may contribute to cell differentiation and reprogramming. Here we will introduce some cases that exemplify how dynamic changes influence the functions and formatons.


#### 3D Genome Reorganization During the Cell Cycle
Mitotic chromosomes are among the most recognizable structures in the cell, yet for over a century their internal organization remains largely unsolved. [Naumova N et](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24200812) applied 3C, 5C and Hi-C techniques together and proposed mechanism about chromotin get condensed upon entering mitosis and how to reserve back in child cells. Here are few discoveries:
- In interphase: highly compartmentalized; cell type-specific organization. In metaphase: homogenous folding state that is locus-independent, common to all chromosomes, and consistent among cell types, suggesting a general principle of metaphase chromosome organization.
- Mitotic chromosomes are folded in two stepsï¼š
