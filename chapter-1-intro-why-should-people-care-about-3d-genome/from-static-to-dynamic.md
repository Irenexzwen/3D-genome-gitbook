#2 Chromotin dynamics 
Although some aspects of the 3D genome architecture are conserved in different cell types, notable reorganization can happen in distinct biological processes and cell types. Dramatic changes may include mitosis process or X chromosome inactivation. Subtles changes may also important and may contribute to cell differentiation and reprogramming. Here we will introduce some cases that exemplify how dynamic changes influence the functions and formatons.
