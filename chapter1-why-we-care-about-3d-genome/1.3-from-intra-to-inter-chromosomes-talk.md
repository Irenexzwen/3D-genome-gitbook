# 1.3 From intra to inter chromosomes "talk"

Usually, in order to accomplish various functions for living, a cell nuclei require complex but precise three-dimensional architecture or even four-dimensional variation of chromosome to establish cell-specific gene-expression programs. 

Through out years, lots of endeavors have been made to understand intra-chromosomal interactions by understanding how chromosomes _fold_. This question leads to the discovery of functional and structural elements like TADs, CTCF, cohesin, lncRNAs \(introduced in 1.1\) and so on.

However, it's been a long time since people first raised the hypothesis that chromosomes occupy defined volumes at defined positions, and that they interact with neighboring chromosomes by observing constant number and structural persistence of chromosomes during interphase. \(Carl Rabl 1885, [Cremer et al,. 2006](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b91a/9b9be43ec7e1a10642bf6c44e6a76156637a.pdf)\) . More recently,  advanced technologies both from imaging and high throughput sequencing blaze the trail to understand inter chromosomes interaction. 

Let's see some real examples while bearing in mind questions such as: What are the mechanisms of inter chromosomes interactions and what is the driven force of these interactions?
