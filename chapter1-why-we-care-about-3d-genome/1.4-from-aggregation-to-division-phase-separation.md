# 1.4 From aggregation to division - phase separation

## What is phase separation? 

Phase separation refers to the spontaneous partitioning of a system into subsystems with distinct macroscopic properties \([Weber et al,. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09552)\). 

### Phase separation in daily life:

There is one kind of cold sauce or dressing made from a mixture of vinegar, oil, pepper, and salt, to which various flavorings may be added called vinaigrette. People are sometimes find annoying when make vinaigrette and leave it, but only come back to find that the oil and vinegar have de-mixed into two different phases: an oil phase and a vinegar phase \(you could only mix them add some other egg whites, which serves as an[ _emulgator_ ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulgator)\). 

![Figure1 Vinaigrette emulsion &#xA9;www.seriouseats.com](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2824%29.png)

This kind of liquid de-mixing is called [emulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion), which usually distinguish from [suspension ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_%28chemistry%29)\(liquid-solid\) mixture. _**One intriguing question is that: What drives demixing and how to sustain mixture state?**_ 

Before we answer this question, we first review some of the basic physics of _**different state**_ \([A. Hyman et al,. 2014](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100913-013325)\)_**.**_ 

> A **liquid** is a state of matter in which components can easily rearrange. Roughly speaking, we can distinguish liquids from solids, in which components do not easily rearrange and exhibit a different degree of order. More precisely, in solids, particles are caged; in other words, particles keep their specific neighborhood for a long time. In liquids, particles change their neighborhood quickly.

> A **solid** is a material that can be cast in an arbitrary shape, and the system keeps a memory of this reference shape for very long times. If it is deformed, it will tend to return to the initial shape, unless it breaks. The property with which it resists shape deformation is called shear elasticity.
>
> A **gel** usually means a cross-linked network of polymeric structures. In biology, we usually think of biological gels as typical examples of physical gels, because they are held together by forces that are weaker than covalent bonds. One important type of gel in biology is a hydrogel. A hydrogel is a gel that has a high water content and cross-linked components that are water soluble. This means that water enters and swells the gel, and squeezing out water requires an external force \(nuclear pore complex and formation of structures by RNA-binding proteins.

#### What drives mixing or demixing?

**Mixing:** Multicomponent systems often tend to mix spontaneously and are then found in a homogeneous mixed state.This is a consequence of a system’s tendency to increase entropy. Entropy characterizes the amount of dis-order in a system. [The second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics) states that entropy increases when processes happen spontaneously. Therefore, the mixing entropy generally drives the mixing of initially unmixed components.To mix, particles must be transported, which typically occurs via diffusion. How is this diffusive transport related to the mixing entropy? In general, particle flux is driven by differences in chemical potential.

**Demixing**: If mixing will increase the entropy, in the case of vinaigrette, why is entropy not driving the system to a mixed state?  The separation into two phases is driven by the physical interactions between the oil molecules and “vinegar molecules.” Specifically, if oil molecules neighbor other oil molecules, the system has lower energy than if oil molecules neighbor “vinegar molecules.” It is this energy reduction by demixing that opposes entropy-driven mixing.

#### How to sustain mixing state?

Basically, there are two kinds of mechanism for a system to remain phase separation state \([C. Lee at el,. 2018](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aae510/meta)\): 

**1\) Equilibrium \(passive\) phase separation** 

Interactions between molecules can cause a **homogeneous system** to undergo a phase separation, i.e. the spontaneous partitioning of a system into multiple phases of distinct properties such as concentration. The transition from the homogeneous state to the phase-separated state is controlled by parameters such as temperature, pressure or concentrations.

**Figure3** shows a equilibrium phase diagram of a ternary mixture composed of molecules P \(red disks\), S \(blue disks\) and C \(not shown\). Outside the phase boundary \(green curve\) the system is homogeneous \(‘’ symbol\). Inside the phase boundary \(‘♦’ symbol\) the system phase separates into two phases ‘in’ and ‘out’ of distinct concentrations. The coexistence concentrations Pˆin,out, Sˆin,out are given by the intersections between the tie-lines \(straight lines\) and the phase boundary.

**2\) Non-equilibrium \(active\) phase separation**

The presence of non-equilibrium chemical reactions \(for instance, consuming ATP\)  have been proposed recently to explain multi-drop stability in the cytoplasm, as well as being a mechanism to control the formation, dissolution and size of membrane-less organelles. For example: [centrioles ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centriole)\([Zwicker et al,. 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/26/E2636)\) , [stress granules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_granule) \([JD Wurtz et al,. 2018](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aab549)\). We will discuss more about non-equilibrium \(active\) phase separation in cell next.

**Figure4  Model of non-equilibrium phase separation in the cell cytoplasm.** We consider the ternary mixture from section 2.2 with the addition of chemical reactions. Molecules P can convert into S with the rate constant k and vice versa with the rate constant h \(equation \(6\)\). S does not participate to phase separation, i.e. its concentration remains continuous at the drop interfaces \(Sˆin = Sˆout\). © J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. C. Lee at el,. 2018.

### Phase separation in cell

Cell functions are the results from chains of reactions happen in the interior cell. A cell is a combo of many modules and elements. Be capable of precise functions, cells have evolved more than meticulous to be organized. On top of the functions, one serious problem is that: **How do they organize complex biochemical reactions in space?** It turns out that cells have at least two strategies nevertheless one is very familiar to most of us, the other type of strategy has mindblowed the community in recent years. 

The first strategy is compartmentalization,
