## What is 4D Nucleome
To determine how the genome operates, we need to understand not only the linear encoding of information along chromosomes, but also its **three-dimensional organization and its dynamics across time**, that is, the ‘4D nucleome’.

## Current dilemma in understanding 4D nucleome
- Different experimental cell systems and approaches are used that together with the absence of **shared benchmarks** for assay performance have led to observations that cannot be directly compared. 
- Iimited ability to **integrate** different data types (for example, chromatin interaction data and imaging-based distance measurements)。
- Lack of approaches that can measure and account for **cell-to-cell variability** in chromosome and nuclear organization.
- Lack of **mechanistic insights** into the relationships between chromosome conformation and nuclear processes, including transcription, DNA replication and chromosome segregation.

## Goals and Strategies 
### Goals:
- Develop, benchmark, validate and standardize a wide array of **technologies to analyse** the 4D nucleome
- **Integrate**, analyse and model datasets obtained with these technologies to obtain a comprehensive view of the 4D nucleome
- Investigate the **functional role** of various structural features of chromosome organization in transcription, DNA replication and other nuclear processes. 

###Strategies:
- A set of **common cell lines** will be studied to enable direct cross- validation of data that are obtained with different methods [table](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23884#t1).
- **Standards for data formats** and quality will be established so that data can be shared broadly.
- **Computational and analytical tools** will be developed to analyse individual datasets and to integrate, compare and cross-validate data obtained with different technologies.
- Develope multiple ways to measure **how DNA and trans-acting factors influence** on the 4D nucleosome.
- Develop a **consistent terminology** to describe nuclear features and biophysically derived principles guiding chromosome folding.
- **Compare and integrate** the wealth of information that is anticipated to be generated by the Network.
- Build a shared **database** and a public 4DN data browser includes all data, detailed protocols, engineered cell lines and reagents used across the Network.
