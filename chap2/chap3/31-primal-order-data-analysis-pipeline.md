# 3.1 Assessment ofPrimary-order Chromatin
Genomic regions with dense nucleo- somes are more tightly packed (i.e., “closed”), whereas nucleosome- depleted regions are more accessible (i.e., “open”) for interactions with regulators and are therefore regarded as the primary locations ofregulatory elements.
