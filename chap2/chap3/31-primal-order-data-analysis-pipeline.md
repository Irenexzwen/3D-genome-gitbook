# 3.1 Assessment of Primary-order Chromatin
Genomic regions with dense nucleo- somes are more tightly packed (i.e., “closed”), whereas nucleosome- depleted regions are more accessible (i.e., “open”) for interactions with regulators and are therefore regarded as the primary locations ofregulatory elements. 

## 3.2.1 Features of data

**Figure1.Fragmentation methods and read out features comparison between four methods.**MNase is specially sensitive to open chromotin areas and it is exonucleas which maps regions that are protected by nucleosomes (large open regions are digested). DNase-seq and ATAC-seq are used to sequence and map exposed regions of DNA.
