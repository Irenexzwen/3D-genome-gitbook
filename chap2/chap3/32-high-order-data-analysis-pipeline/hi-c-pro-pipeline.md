# Hi-C pro pipeline
Thorough documentation can be found [here](https://nservant.github.io/HiC-Pro/).
> HiC-Pro was designed to process Hi-C data, from raw fastq files (paired-end Illumina data) to the normalized contact maps. It supports the main Hi-C protocols, including digestion protocols as well as protocols that do not require restriction enzyme such as DNase Hi-C. In practice, HiC-Pro can be used to process dilution Hi-C, in situ Hi-C, DNase Hi-C, Micro-C, capture-C, capture Hi-C or HiChip data. Each step of the workflow can be run independantly. HiC-Pro includes a fast implementatation of the iterative correction method (see the iced python library for more information). In addition, HiC-Pro can use phasing data to build [allele specific contact maps](https://nservant.github.io/HiC-Pro/AS.html#as).
