### ChIP-seq<a name="a"></a>
### DNase-seq<a name="b"></a>
### ATAC-seq<a name="c"></a>

### MNase-seq<a name="d"></a>
Nucleosome-associated DNA is particularly insensitive to digestion by **micrococcal nuclease (MNase)**. With this feature, MNase-seq [[5]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2007.05.009) [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2008.02.022) [[7]](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.545) is a powerful tool to study the open chromotin region. The enzyme cut the exposed DNA with sticky ends. Just like the packman shows, the enzyme will digest the helix until it reaches an obstruction，such as a nuecleosome or other proteins [[8]](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3788).
### FAIRE-seq<a name="e"></a>
FAIRE-seq [[6]](http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.5533506) is **Formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements followed by sequencing**. Nucleosome-bound DNA is crosslinked and removed by phenol–chloroform extraction and the remaining nucleosome- free DNA is analyzed by microarray or sequencing.This is a simpler assay for open chromatin than DNase-seq, although its **resolution** is somewhat lower (around 200bp).
