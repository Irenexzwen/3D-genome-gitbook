### Higer-order and Primal order of chromosome structure 
The structure of chromosomal DNA can be categorized as “higher-order” and “primary-order” according to the folding complexity.

Gene expression and biological functions intimately rely on the interactions between regions (higher-order structure) and the accessi- bility of chromatin (primary-order structure), which are mediated by protein complexes and epigenetic modifications.

#### Higher order 
The higher-order genome structure is most clearly visible during the interphase and mitosis when chromatin fibers extensively fold into chromosomes. An interphase chromosome is formed by a tightly coiled 250 nm chromatid. Microscopic imaging has demonstrated that each chromosome may be confined to genomic compartments. Within these compartments, intra-chromosomal interactions are most frequent within regions known as megabase-sized topologically associ- ating domains (TADs).
