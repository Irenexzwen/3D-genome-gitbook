##2.1 Image based
Before the advent of C-technologies, the predominant method to study 3D genome organization was image-based methods. 

###2.1.1 Visualize DNA & RNA
#### FISH

#### HIPMap
 
###2.1.2 Ultra structure and 3D organization
 - EM based (ChromEM)
 - X-ray based 
- Spatial and dynamic 3D nuclear organization
 - Wide-field / confocal / multiphoton 
 - LLS
 - etc ..
