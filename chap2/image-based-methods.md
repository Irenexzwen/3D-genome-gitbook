Before the advent of C-technologies, the predominant method to study 3D genome organization was image-based methods. 

- visualize DNA & RNA
 - FISH
 - HIPMap
 - etc... 
 
- Ultra structure and 3D organization
 - EM based 
 - X-ray based 
- Spatial and dynamic 3D nuclear organization
 - Wide-field / confocal / multiphoton 
 - LLS
 - etc ..
