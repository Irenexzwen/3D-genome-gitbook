# HiGlass 
HiGlass is a web-based tool for exploring genomic contact matrices and tracks.HiGlass is a viewer for HiC and other genomic data. It can be used online (http://higlass.io), or run locally with private data(docker). It uses a client-server achitecture to allow users to view large contact matrices in a web browser (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/30/121889). 


## Distinguished features
 - smooth navigation, continous interface
 - multiple datasets, map link, auto sync, optional sync(by loc or zoom) 
 - various representations (horizontal trianular, vertical triangular, 2D heatmap, 1D track)
 - higly configurable 
 - diff scale of data (linear, log)
 - export (SVG, JSON config) with metadata rather than lengthy url records everything
 - share data local net or publicly
 - locally or web databased

## Get Started
We will unfold the main features of Higlass as follows:
1.
