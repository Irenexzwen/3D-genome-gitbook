Just like the complex structure of one functional protein, a chromosome also has a wired, compacted structure that is flexible during the process of life. Chromatin is a highly compact and organized assembly of DNA and proteins. From a naked single molecular to a visible chromosome, DNA in mammalian is condensed approximately 10,000 to 20,000-fold. We will introduce the experimental tools from two category: “higher-order” and “primary-order” structure of chromosomal DNA according to the folding complexity. 
## Primary order structure
The primary-order chromatin refers to the unpacked chromatin fiber where 11-nm coils of nucleosomes are exposed. The nucleosome is the fundamental unit of chromatin. Each nucleosome comprises 147 bp of DNA wound 1.65 times around core histones [54,74]. Chromatin can be categorized into two varieties: euchromatin and heterochromatin [31]. They differ in termsofthe over- all compaction of nucleosomes, numbers of genes and transcription levels. The loosely packed regions form the “euchromatin”,whereas the densely-packed regions form the “heterochromatin” and represent the less accessible part of the genome [5]. Typically, euchromatin is enriched in genes, and transcription in this region is active. Heterochro- matin usually consists ofrepetitive sequences and forms structures such as centromeres. However, the condensed structure ofsome heterochro- matin can become loose and transcription may take place when under certain developmental or environmental conditions [38,45]. Gene

## Higher order structure
The higher-order genome structure is most clearly visible during
the interphase and mitosis when chromatin fibers extensively fold into chromosomes. An interphase chromosome is formed by a tightly coiled 250 nm chromatid. Microscopic imaging has demonstrated that each chromosome may be confined to genomic compartments [59]. Within these compartments, intra-chromosomal interactions are most frequent within regions known as megabase-sized topologically associ- ating domains (TADs). The active TADs are rich in genes, open chroma- tin marks, transcription factors and DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs)
and show early replication. In contrast, the inactive TADs harbor few genes and DHSs and show late replication [77,80,91]
