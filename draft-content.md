# 1.Tools for explore 3D genome
##1.1 microscopy based image 
    - FISH etc
    - pros and cons
    
##1.2- C-Techs (chromosome conformation capture)-coupled 
inferred from pairwise contact frequencies, proximity ligation. 
(expalin what one and many mean, pros and cons. )
(draw a illustration try to cover the main experimental difference between diff methods)
