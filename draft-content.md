#1 General features of 3D genome organization 
##1.1 multi-scale folding 
[1][2][3]
- nucleosome-nucleosome interactions
- chromosome territories
- sub TAD and insulation neighborhoods
- chromatin loops
- TAD(Topologically Associating Domains)
- Compartments
- chromatin loops

## 1.2 architectural proteins
- mediator
- cohesin
- CTCF

## 1.3 non-coding RNAs binding 



# 2.Tools for explore 3D genome
##2.1 Image based
    - visualize DNA & RNA
    - ultra structure and 3D
    - dynamic 3D organization
    
##2.2- C-Techs (chromosome conformation capture)-coupled 
inferred from pairwise contact frequencies, proximity ligation. 
(expalin what one and many mean, pros and cons. )
