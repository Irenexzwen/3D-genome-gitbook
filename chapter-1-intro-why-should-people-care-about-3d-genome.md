# Why should people care about 3D genome 

Around 15 years ago, one of the greatest feats of exploration in history - The Human Genome Project (HGP) was copleted. This inward voyage of discovery effort to sequence and map all of the genes - together known as the genome - of members of our species, Homo sapiens. Completed in April 2003, the HGP gave us the ability, for the first time, to read nature's complete genetic blueprint for building a human being.
