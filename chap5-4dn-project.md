### What is 4D Nucleome

To determine how the genome operates, we need to understand not only the linear encoding of information along chromosomes, but also its **three-dimensional organization and its dynamics across time**, that is, the ‘4D nucleome’.

### Current dilemma in understanding 4D nucleome

* Different experimental cell systems and approaches are used that together with the absence of **shared benchmarks** for assay performance have led to observations that cannot be directly compared. 
* Iimited ability to **integrate** different data types \(for example, chromatin interaction data and imaging-based distance measurements\)。
* Lack of approaches that can measure and account for **cell-to-cell variability** in chromosome and nuclear organization.
* Lack of **mechanistic insights** into the relationships between chromosome conformation and nuclear processes, including transcription, DNA replication and chromosome segregation.

### Goals and Strategies 

#### Goals:

* Develop, benchmark, validate and standardize a wide array of **technologies to analyse** the 4D nucleome
* **Integrate**, analyse and model datasets obtained with these technologies to obtain a comprehensive view of the 4D nucleome
* Investigate the **functional role** of various structural features of chromosome organization in transcription, DNA replication and other nuclear processes. 

#### Strategies:

* A set of **common cell lines** will be studied to enable direct cross- validation of data that are obtained with different methods [table](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23884#t1).
* **Standards for data formats** and quality will be established so that data can be shared broadly.
* **Computational and analytical tools** will be developed to analyse individual datasets and to integrate, compare and cross-validate data obtained with different technologies.
* Develope multiple ways to measure **how DNA and trans-acting factors influence** on the 4D nucleosome.
* Develop a **consistent terminology** to describe nuclear features and biophysically derived principles guiding chromosome folding.
* **Compare and integrate** the wealth of information that is anticipated to be generated by the Network.
* Build a shared **database** and a public 4DN data browser includes all data, detailed protocols, engineered cell lines and reagents used across the Network.

### Data sharing and standards

* Need to develope common formats to represent three-dimensional interactions.
* Efficient data structure to store sparse matrix \(interaction matrix is sparse\)
* Standards to unify data and metadata from different manufacturers for imaging technologies.
* Define a set of appropriate metadata fields and minimum metadata requirements such that sufficient and useful details are available to other investigators outside the Network.
* Develope a set of measures for assessing data quality and determining

  appropriate thresholds.
