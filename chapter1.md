# Chapter1    Tools for Hi-C data visualization

Let's first discuss the **framework** of this chapter before more details will be added. 
We'll first walk through the **motivation** for visualizing complex dataset and then discuss the **object, needs and plights** in Hi-C data visualization. Then we'll provide a roadmap with some comparison of some of the most popular softwares available, based on some criteria that people may refer to. Finally a case study will be illustrated to prepare people for practical need. 

## 1.Motivation for Vis:
- Explore data feature, find patterns
- Interpretate the data 
- Verify or raise hypothesis

## 2.What data:
### i) Hi-C data:
- What is hi-c data, brief intro. may refer to other chapter 

###ii) Other useful info:
- genome, epigenome
- SNP
- CTCF, ChiP-seq 
- ChIA-PET
- ... 

## 3.Desired feaures of Hi-C Vis tools:
- **Multi-omics** data, multi-techs data. Optional for users 
- **Vivid presentation**: Circos, Heatmaps, Birdview.
- **Interactive** presentation: mouse zoom-in & out, panning, sliding. 
- Easy to **share**: 
    - Cloud based, docker based, block chain(for server), URL share, QR code.
    - Records for eaxct parameters
